    Description:
        Fits the model to the training dataset contained in x and y.
    Args:
        x: has to be a numpy.array, a matrix of dimension m * n:
            (number of training examples, number of features).
        y: has to be a numpy.array, a vector of dimension m * 1:
            (number of training examples, 1).
        theta: has to be a numpy.array, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1:
            (number of features + 1, 1).
        alpha: has to be a float, the learning rate.
        max_iter: has to be an int, the number of iterations done during the gradient descent.
    Return:
        new_theta: numpy.array, a vector of dimension (number of features + 1, 1).
        None if there is a matching dimension problem.
        None if x, y, theta, alpha or max_iter is not of expected type.
    Raises:
        This function should not raise any Exception.
